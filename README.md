- The map is not responsive
- We can’t search for street
- The subject icon is envelope, that’s confusing
- The phone number range is weird - whose number is 11 - 22 characters?
- The message range is weird 20 - 2000 prevents shorter messages
- It shows 2 error messages about empty message-field and subject - same field two error messages
- The response is not too pretty
    - The The fonts are not in line, size etc
    - The lining up is bad, Mabel H! aligning issues in forms
    - The message is blunt - try more polite
  * error message order varies with same input
- The email doesn’t require the “.”
- The language in page is not too sophisticated
- The Error messages are not consistent with style capitalising
- Error messages should be placed better
- How do I book this =)
    - Calendar not responsive, reactive
    - Error messages are baaaaad!!!
    - Must not be null? We have something everywhere
    - Everything we said about the error messages also apply on booking as even worse
    - Availability not available
- The language, is it some lorem ipsum or?
- The wheelchair icon, what is that?

. we cannot choose the date in Calendar, it is not clickable
2. The error message is not clear in Book this room: “Must not be null”
3. The map is not working: no zoom, no clicks
4. It is also not a proper image as we cannot copy it as other pictures
5. In “Thanks for getting in touch ”, the message is split into three lines, while it would be way better to have one clear sentence.
6. Different languages on the same webpage
7. Links at the footer open webpage in the middle: Cookie-Policy - Privacy-Policy 
8. Short names are not welcome: Na Li in booking
9. We can input everything to Phone Number 
10. Name and surname can be meaningful
11. SQL injection, security issues?
12. When I update the webpage, there are some error messages for some milliseconds
13.
